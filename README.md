# py-chatserver
A basic chatserver written in Python. Was more of a practice project than anything else.


# Features
* Probably the worst chatserver you've ever seen, that's for sure
* Custom binary protocol for chat and auth
* Basic auth
* List of online participants
* Uses select() multiplexing

# Notes

No client included, since frontend programming sucks.
